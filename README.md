<!-- #default-branch-Main -->

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## The idea behind the example

**Note:** This example is set up to use the Next.js Pages Router.
As of Next.js 13.4, the newer App Router pattern is stable.

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `Tailwind CSS` and its peer dependencies. If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://styled-components.com/docs).
